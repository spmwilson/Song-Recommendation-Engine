# Song-Recommendation-Engine

This was a project for Colorado State's CS253. It reads from a text file user information including song titles and song ratings. It then uses similarity to predict an unrated song by a particular user. This could be used to predict what song a user might like to hear next, similar to Pandora.

INPUT: Song Titles "song5" and Song Ratings "rating5" Each column in rating5 is a different user.

OUTPUT: Output file with all unrated song values predicted using similarity
